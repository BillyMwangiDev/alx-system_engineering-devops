0x03 Shell Variables and Expansions

This project contains a series of Bash scripts that explore environment variables, local and global variables, arithmetic operations, aliases, and string combinations in a Linux shell environment. Each script demonstrates a specific concept or task related to shell variables and expansions.

Requirements

- Bash shell
- Scripts must start with `#!/bin/bash`
- Scripts should be executable (`chmod u+x <script_name>`)
- Avoid using `&&`, `||`, `;`, `sed`, or `bc` where specified
- Scripts should produce output exactly as described in each task

5-local_variables: List local variables, environment variables, and functions  
6-create_local_variable: Create a local variable  
7-create_global_variable: Create a global variable  
8-true_knowledge: Perform arithmetic using an environment variable  
9-divide_and_rule: Divide one environment variable by another  
10-love_exponent_breath: Raise a number to the power of another using environment variables  
11-binary_to_decimal: Convert a binary number to decimal  
12-combinations: Print all possible two-letter combinations except 'oo'
